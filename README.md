#CSE 1325 Java Project 

This is a collaborative project created by:

- Hardik Kari (https://github.com/yourusername)
- Rohith Tiruvaipati (https://github.com/Zekrom543)

We built this project together as a final project for our object-orientated programming class. We both worked on the managers, models, and main together and still have ideas for future implementation.
